We are a group of students who have studied reproductive history and politics together over the last few months in a course called Reproductive Health, Gender & Power in the U.S., taught by Ziv Eisenberg.

After hearing disturbing news of the leaked SCOTUS draft, we felt moved to take actions and share our learned knowledge of this topic. We hope this website can serve as an educational tool, providing historic context and inspiration for further learning and action.

Under the <b>SCOTUS Draft</b> page, you can read the draft with linked analyses offering historic context and highlighting Alito's inaccuracies and fallacies.

On the <b>History Timeline</b> page, you can find a historic timeline of events related to reproductive health and abortion politics.

In the <b>Visual Archive</b> gallery, you can find an archive of the Roe-era abortion debate, 1970 to the present, including protest materials, logos, merchandise, and newspaper clippings intended for display in public space, created by individuals or collegiate, local, and national organizations. We analyze the terms and visual language used and reference key legislation, historical events, and organizations.

The <b>Resources<page> is a non-comprehensive repository of suggested resources for further learning on reproductive health and politics, leading organizations in this field, and abortion-related funds in states where womxn are at severe risk of losing access to abortion.
